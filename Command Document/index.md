### Introduction

```
Scope. These Multiplayer Instructions gives information to external organizations with regards to
132nd Virtual Wing events. NOTE: These Multiplayer Instructions will not replace each
participating squadron own SOP’s but will make sure that all participating pilots have a common
understanding on how to operate during 132nd Virtual Wing hosted events
```
```
Deviations. Deviations from these procedures require specific approval from participating
squadrons/organizations and should be discussed in the 132nd Virtual Wing forum.
```
```
Recommended changes. Recommendations for changes to these instructions should be addressed
at the 132nd Virtual Wing forums.
```
```
Governing documents: For all units flying in 132nd Virtual Wing events, everyone must adhere to
the following documents:
```
- SPINS: Special Instructions

### Required Mods, Files and Skins

```
Mods and Skins. All required mods, files and skins are obtainable via an OVGME repository.
Please download OVGME-link and refer to the instructions-link how to obtain the files required.
```
```
Ground and Airport Charts. For all ATC operations, it is required pilots have airport charts
including taxiway designations and parking positions available. Maps are available here-link.
```
```
Optional Google Earth Link. Optional for Mission Planning-link.
```
### Real world information

```
Settings. 132nd Virtual Wing combat events will be flown as realistic missions, with random
failures on, external views off. In training events, externals views and F10 map are accessible.
```
```
UniversRadio. All missions during 132nd Virtual Wing hosted events will be flown using
UniversRadio (UR). It is highly recommended that each player test their UR plugin prior to the
mission.
```
```
Respawn. Pilots that are killed during a mission are not allowed to respawn. Pilots that eject, and
are picked up by friendly forces (helicopter landing close to their position) are allowed to
respawn. Killed pilots are however allowed to play on the next mission. Exception to this is
training missions, where pilots are allowed to respawn. If you are experiencing technical issues it
is also allowed to respawn.
```

```
132nd Virtual Wing, 2013:
```
```
Mission time. Most missions in 132nd Virtual Wing hosted events will be started on the
flightlead’s discretion based on their own preparation and start up time. Take-off times and latest
landing times will be given and all flights must adhere to these.
```
```
Timezone. Timezone for all event timings will be UTC/GMT timezone (ZULU time)
```
### Mission flow.

```
Signup. Signup on missions is highly recommended. This is the only chance to guarantee
that an aircraft will be ready for you during the mission. Signups are mandatory for flying
combat missions. Signup for training missions is highly recommended. Sign up as early as
possible in order to make it easier for an event host/mission commander/mission designer to
plan for the event/mission
```
```
First step is to click on the event tab on the website
```
```
Second step is to select your preferred event:
```
```
Third step is to sign up at the desired flight: Scroll down until you see the pilot roster, and
select your preferred flight. Sign up for a specific flight when able, as it will ease the
workload of the host when pilots select their own flights. Also, by if selecting the flight, you
are accepting both flightlead and wingman position. If you require a specific position, sign up
for that position, or state it in the comms-chatter.
```

```
132nd Virtual Wing, 2013:
```
Fourth step is to review your flight tasking information on the ATO:

Once you are looking at the ATO, find your flight(Under documents on the 132nd website
you will find a link to ATO Manual, which describes the ATO in more detail for an
explanation what everything means. Here you will find all necessary information for your
flight):


```
132nd Virtual Wing, 2013:
```
Fifth step is to fill out a flightplan. Click on your flights mission number to enter your flights
planning page:

Inside your flights planning page, fill out the desired flightplan information to aid the
controllers support you in your mission: (Fill out your enroute intentions, and your estimated
landing time.


```
132nd Virtual Wing, 2013:
```
Example:

Inside your flights planning page, there is also a comms chatter, for internal planning within
the flight. NOTE: In order to keep main comschatter as easy to overlook, please keep internal
coms in the internal flight comschatter.


```
132nd Virtual Wing, 2013:
```
Brief. Prior to server start, all players are encouraged to perform flightbriefs prior to the
mission. Flightlead will be in charge of conducting a flightbrief, and Package commanders
will be responsible to conduct a package brief. If conducting training missions, flightbriefs
may be skipped, or can be taken in pit.

Server start. Server will be unpaused at timing set in event information, normally 60 minutes
prior to first scheduled takeoff.

Conduct of mission. Every flight will conduct their mission according to these Multiplayer
instructions, SPINS and internal SOP's/operating instructions.

After Action Report (AAR). After completion of the mission all pilots are highly
encouraged to fill out an After Action Report on the event section of the 132nd Virtual Wing
website.

Once you enter the event page, find the event under previous events, and it shows that AAR
is pending in red when you have not filled out the AAR:


```
132nd Virtual Wing, 2013:
```
Find your flight and callsign, and click to enter the After Action Report page of your sortie:

Then fill out the information you have (Fill out how long you have been in the pit, your
mission outcome, your objectives and if you reached them, on the tactical feedback, give a
quick summary of your mission, provide any intelligence information you might have, as this
can help other flights later, and also any feedback on own performance, or others. If you have
any feedback to mission design you can state that, and for administrative feedback you can
add issues with the hosting of the event, rubber banding, lagging, UR/TS/DCS issues, or
other administrative aspects of the event):


```
132nd Virtual Wing, 2013:
```
### Air Tasking Order

```
132nd Virtual Wing will use an Air Tasking Order to task flights. The ATO is published on
the 132nd Virtual Wing website. The ATO can be found under Event, View full ATO. There
is also a shortcut to View ATO, if you click into one of the events. See pictures above
```
```
After users have signed up on the event page on the 132nd Virtual Wing website, they should
check in on the website regularly until mission start. Once signed up, please note the mission
number on the tasking. Also look at the tasking information, as there might be information
there that are needed for your mission. See appendix 1 for explanation of the signal view of
```

```
132nd Virtual Wing, 2013:
```
```
taskings. In addition, under documents on the 132nd website you will find a link to ATO
Manual, which describes the ATO in more detail.
```
### Airspace information

```
Airport airspace. For all airspace users in 132nd Virtual Wing hosted events, airport airspace is
described in GND and VAD CHARTS A10C by ARIES.
```
```
Restricted areas. There are several restricted airspace areas. These areas will be described in the
SPINS. Follow procedures in the SPINS on how to use and request these airspaces.
```
```
Mandatory files for the range: In order to make sure you will have the targets outlined in the
range, a ll pilots need to have the most recent versions of the required mods and files. All required
mods, files and skins are obtainable via an OVGME repository. Please download OVGME-link
and refer to the instructions-link how to obtain the files required
```
### Communications

```
Frequencies. Frequencies are given a name and a number to make change of frequencies easier.
See 132nd Virtual Wing website, under Documents, 132nd Operational Frequencies, for the
valid names and frequencies in use.
```
```
Airfield frequencies are ingame frequency + .100MHZ/.200MHZ. A airfield having ingame
frequency 123.000 MHZ will have GROUND UR frequency 123.100 MHZ. and TOWER UR
frequency 123.200 MHZ. If an approach frequency is used, it will be stated. In the TBLISI area,
APPROACH uses frequency 127.200 for all operations within Tblisi TMA (Tblisi Terminal
Maneuver Area).
```
```
All other frequencies not listed in the 132nd Operational Frequencies list are free to use at the
discretion of any participating squadron participating squadrons.
```
```
Each flight will be given 2 frequencies (UHF, VHF AM or VHF FM) for use during a flight.
```
```
Guard frequency. Guard frequency for all FW operations will be 243.000 MHZ. When calling
on Guard frequency, make sure to state that you are calling on Guard so other pilots know you
are transmitting on Guard and not their UHF frequency. All FW aircraft are required to listen to
Guard at all times when airborne.
```
### Combat Search And Rescue

In the 132nd Virtual Wing, the Mi-8 is used as a CSAR plattform that can pick-up downed pilots.
The procedure to be able to be picked up is explained here:

WHAT TO DO WHEN EJECTED


```
132nd Virtual Wing, 2013:
```
- Initial call will be on UHF GUARD (243.000). This can be a mayday call from the pilot in trouble
or a call by another flight member.
- The flight lead is responsible for passing on as much details about their downed pilot's position to
AWACS.
- Downed pilot can also communicate with AWACS (see below)
- AWACS will coordinate the CSAR mission on the CSAR net, or any NET as directed per AWACS

If & when the rescue helicopter approached the downed pilots location, the downed pilot (Skinny)
will communicate with the rescue helicopter for talk-on and terminal guidance.

##### GETTING IN

You can walk around with your pilot using your joystick and rudder axes. The movement is not
visible for other players in the current DCS version. If the RESCUE BIRD lands, walk into it where
the doors are open. You will now be inside (with your head sticking out). Make sure the Mi-8 pilot
can close the doors. DONT MOVE WHILE INSIDE (as there is a risk of you falling out). Note that
the Mi-8 pilot is not able to see you if you have moved from your position, and is 100% reliant on
your talk-on.

EXAMPLE ( Watch from 10:01 onwards)
https://youtu.be/mrxCmf_FLos?t=

SPINS will contain more detailed CSAR information

### Airfield operations

```
All movement on the airfield will be according to Aerodrome charts (GND charts) by ARIES.
```
```
Airspace Control Zone. All movement within an airfields Airspace Control Zone shall be
broadcasted on the Airfields UR frequency. Airspace Control Zone is shown in the Visual
Approach and Departure Charts (VAD Charts A-10).
```
```
ATC. When possible there will be a human ATC / AWACS operator supporting the mission.
When there won’t be a human ATC, all calls on the airport should still be transmitted blindly, so
that other people can act accordingly when they know your intentions. In this scenario you
inform other pilots of your operations rather than ask for clearances.
```
### ATC procedures

```
ATC Ope rations is one of the strong point s of the 132nd, and relative ly unique in the DCS
community. Please refer to the document 132-TTP-5-ATC and Airbase Operations, found in the
Downl oa ds s ection of t he 132nd for ums.
